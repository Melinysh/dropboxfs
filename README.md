# dropboxfs

A [FUSE](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse) for seamlessly interacting with Dropbox written in Go. Dropboxfs allows you to mount your Dropbox and use it as if it was a local filesystem. All changes made through dropboxfs will be sync'ed with Dropbox. The Dropbox [linux daemon](https://www.dropbox.com/install-linux) synchronizes your entire Dropbox folder before you can use it, but dropboxfs is smarter and only loads your data when it needs to.

### How to run it

[Register an app with Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps) and generate an access token for dropboxfs to use. Make sure your system has [FUSE](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse) installed.

```
git clone https://github.com/Melinysh/dropboxfs.git
cd dropboxfs
go get .
go build
export DROPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=<Access Token Here>
./dropboxfs <MountPoint>
```
